# Ben's Pretty Good Salsa


### Ingredients:  

2 large, firm tomatoes, diced (remove goopy bits)  
1 medium to large onion, diced  
1 large bunch cilantro, finely chopped  
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
4 tbsp olive oil  
3 tbsp lemon juice OR 1 medium lemon  
2 tbsp vinegar  
1 to 2 tbsp sriracha  
1.5 tbsp salt  
0.5 to 1 tbsp cayenne pepper  
0.25 to 0.5 tbsp cumin (optional)
0.25 tbsp coriander seed, ground (optional)
  
Tips:
- To mellow out the onion, peel apart and soak it in water for 10 minutes before dicing.
- It is very important to let the salsa sit overnight for the flavours to blend.
- If using coriander seed, lightly toast it in a pan over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally to prevent burning. Stop when the aroma starts to come out, then grind it immediately.
